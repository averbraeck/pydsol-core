"""
The interfaces module defines common interfaces for the major classes 
in the pydsol framework. The use of interfaces (aka abstract base classes
in Python) avoids circular references in the import of modules. 

As an example, the Simulator class refers to a Replication and a Model in 
its initialize method. Both the Replication classes and the Model class
have references to, and use methods from the Simulator class. The interfaces
module that defines the core 'contract' for the Simulator, Model, Experiment,
Replication and Statistics helps to avoid circular references, but also 
defines the core functionalities of these central classes in the pydscol
framework.

Instead of combining all classes in one huge pydsol module with 
thousands of lines of code, the interfaces nicely decouple the definition
of the classes and their implementation, and they avoid circular referencing 
of modules to each other. Think of the use of this particular interface 
module as the .h files in C++.

    The SimulatorInterface defines the key methods for any Simulator
    to be used in the pydsol-framework. Different types of Simulators can
    be used, e.g., fixed time increment simulators (time ticks) for ABM
    and for solving differential equations, and variable time increments
    for discrete-event models. Simulators can run as-fast-as-possible or
    be synchronized with the wall clock time, etc.
