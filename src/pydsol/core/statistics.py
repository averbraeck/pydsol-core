"""
The statistics objects collect observations and produce summarized information
about the observations, such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum value,
and maximum value. The statistics module has four types of statistics objects
in three different families. 

The statistics objects are:

* The *Counter* that collects integer values, such as the occurrences of an 
  event, and produces the count as the statistics result. The counter receives
  its observations through a method ``register(int_value)``
* The *Tally* that collects floating point values such as processing times,
  and produces statistics results such as the mean, standard deviation, and
  variance of the submitted values. The Tally receives its observations
  through a method ``register(float_value)``
* The *WeightedTally* that collects floating point values with an associated
  weight factor, for example the number of entities in a queue as the 
  observations and the duration of the particular queue length as the weights,
  and produces results such as weighted average and weighted variance of the
  observations. The WeightedTally receives its observations through a method 
  ``register(float_weight, float_value)``
* The *TimestampWeightedTally* that is a specialization of the WeightedTally
  where the weights are derived automatically from the intervals between 
  timestamps. Each observation is provided with the time when the value of a 
  property changed. The TimestampWeightedTally receives its observations
  through a method ``register(float_timestamp, float_value)``  
   
The statistics families are:

1. *Ordinary statistics*. These receive the observations by explicitly calling 
   the `register` method for any of the four statistics. The classes are 
   `Counter`, `Tally`, `WeightedTally`, and `TimestampWeightedTally`.
2. *Event-based statistics*. These receive the observations by listening to
   an EventProducer (see the pubsub.py module) that 'fires' events to one or
   more listeners, among which the Event-based statistics. This way, the 
   statistic gathering and processing is decoupled from the process in the 
   simulation that generates the data: there can be zero, one, or many 
   statistics listeners for each data producing object in the simulation. The
   Event-based statistics also fire events with the values of the calculated
   statistics values, so a GUI-element such as a graph or table can be
   automatically updated when values of the statistic change. The classes 
   extend the 'ordinary statistics', and are called `EventBasedCounter`, 
   `EventBasedTally`, `EventBasedWeightedTally`, and 
   `EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally`.
3. *Simulation statistics*. These receive the observations in the same way as
   the Event-based statistics, but are also aware of the Simulator. This
   means they can subscribe to the Simulator's WARMUP_EVENT taking care
   that the statistics are initialized appropriately. Additionally, the 
   `SimPersistent` class that extends `EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally` can
   retrieve the timestamps directly from the Simulator. Additionally, the
   Simulation Statistics register themselves in the model as output statistics
   when the model has been defined when they are created. Note that this is
   the case when the statistics are defined in the construct_model method
   of the Model, but not when they are defined in the constructor of the
   Model. The Simulation Statistics classes are:
   
   * `SimCounter` extending `EventBasedCounter`
   * `SimTally` extending `EventBasedTally`
   * `SimWeightedTally`, extending `EventBasedWeightedTally`
   * `SimPersistent`, extending `EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally`
   
Examples
--------
    **SimCounter** is used in discrete-event simulation to count the number of
    occurrences in a model, such as the number of generated entities, or the
    number of processed entities by a server.
    
    **SimTally** is used in discrete-event simulation to calculate statistics 
    for the waiting time in a queue, the time-in-system of an entity, or the 
    processing time at a server.
    
    **SimPersistent** is used in discrete-event simulation to calculate 
    statistics for the length of a queue or the utilization of a server.
    
Notes
-----
    The average of the SimTally can be calculated as:
    
    .. math::
       \\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\frac{x_{i}}{n}}
    
    where :math:`x_{i}` are the observations and :math:`n` is the number of
    observations (only observations after the warmup time are included).
    
    The average of the SimPersistent can be calculated as:
    
    .. math::
       \\mu = \\int_{0}^{T}{\\frac{x_{t}}{T} dt}

    where :math:`x_{t}` is the stepwise changing x-value (it changes at each 
    observation) and :math:`T` is the total time of the simulation (after the
    warmup time). it can be through of as the time-normalized surface 'under'
    the curve of the observed variable.

    def stdev(self, biased: bool=True) -> float:
        r"""
        Return the standard deviation of all observations since the 
        initialization. The sample standard deviation is defined as the 
        square root of the variance. The biased standard deviation needs at 
        least 1 observation, the unbiased version needs at least 2.
        
        The formula for the biased (population) standard deviation is:
        
         .. math::
            \sigma = \sqrt{ {\frac{1}{n}} \left( \sum{x_{i}^2} - 
            \left( \sum{x_{i}} \right)^2 / n \right) }

        The formula for the unbiased (sample) standard deviation is:
        
         .. math::
            S = \sqrt{ {\frac{1}{n - 1}} \left( \sum{x_{i}^2} - 
            \left( \sum{x_{i}} \right)^2 / n \right) }
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        biased: bool
            Whether to return the biased (population) standard deviation or the 
            unbiased (sample) standard deviation. By default, biased is True 
            and the population standard deviation is returned.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The (unbiased) sample standard deviation of all observations 
            since the initialization, or NaN when not enough observations 
            were registered.

    def skewness(self, biased: bool=True) -> float:
        r"""
        Return the skewness of all observations since the statistic 
        initialization. For the biased (population) skewness, at least two 
        observations are needed; for the unbiased (sample) skewness, at least
        three observations are needed. If there are too few observations,
        NaN is returned. The method returns the biased (population) skewness
        as the default.
        
        The formula for the biased (population) skewness is:
        
         .. math::
            Skew_{biased} = \frac{ \sum{(x_{i} - \mu)^3} }{n . \sigma^3} 
        
        where :math:`\sigma^2` is the biased (population) variance. So 
        the denominator is equal to :math:`n . population\_var^{3/2}`.

        There are different formulas to calculate the unbiased (sample) 
        skewness from the biased (population) skewness. Minitab, for 
        instance calculates unbiased skewness as:
        
         .. math::
            Skew_{unbiased} = Skew_{biased} {\left(  
            \frac{n - 1}{n} \right)} ^{3/2}
            
        whereas SAS, SPSS and Excel calculate it as:
        
         .. math::
            Skew_{unbiased} = Skew_{biased} \sqrt{\frac{n (n - 1)}{n - 2} }
        
        Here we follow the last mentioned formula. All formulas converge 
        to the same value with larger n.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        biased: bool

            unbiased (sample) skewness. By default, biased is True and the 
            population skewness is returned.
        
        Returns
        -------
        float

    def kurtosis(self, biased: bool=True) -> float:
        r"""
        Return the kurtosis of all observations since the statistic 
        initialization. The biased (sample) kurtosis calculation needs three 
        observations, and the unbiased (population) calculation needs four 
        observations. When too few observations were registered, NaN is 
        returned.
        
        The formula for the biased (population) kurtosis is:
        
         .. math::
            kurt_{biased} = \frac{\sum{(x_{i} - \mu)^4}}{n.\sigma^4}
        
        where :math:`\sigma^2` is the population variance. So the denominator 
        is equal to :math:`n . pop\_var^2`.
        
        The formula for the unbiased (sample) kurtosis is:
        
         .. math::
            kurt_{unbiased} = \frac{\sum{(x_{i} - \mu)^4}}{(n-1).S^4}
        
        where :math:`S^2` is the sample variance. So the denominator is equal 
        to :math:`(n - 1) . sample\_var^2`.

    def excess_kurtosis(self, biased: bool=True) -> float:
        r"""
        Return the excess kurtosis of the registered data. The kurtosis value 
        of the normal distribution is 3. The (biased) excess kurtosis is the 
        kurtosis value shifted by -3 to be 0 for the normal distribution. The  
        biased excess kurtosis needs three observations; if fewer observations
        were registered, NaN is returned.
 
        The formula for the biased (population) excess kurtosis is:
        
         .. math::
            ExcessKurt_{biased} = Kurt_{biased} - 3
        
        The unbiased (sample) excess kurtosis is the sample-corrected value 
        of the biased excess kurtosis. When fewer than four observations were 
        registered, NaN is returned for the unbiased excess kurtosis. Several 
        formulas exist to calculate the sample excess kurtosis from the 
        biased excess kurtosis. Here we use:
        
         .. math::
            ExcessKurt_{unbiased} = \frac{n - 1}{(n - 2) (n - 3)}
            \left( (n + 1) ExcessKurt_{biased} + 6 \right)

        SAS, SPSS and Excel.

class WeightedTally(StatisticsInterface):
    """
    The WeightedTally is a statistics object that calculates descriptive 
    statistics for weighted observations, such as weighted mean, weighted 
    variance, minimum observation, maximum observation, etc. 
    
    The initialize() method resets the statistics object. The initialize 
    method can, for instance, be called when the warmup period of the 
    simulation experiment has completed. 

    In a sense, the weighted tally can be seen as a normal Tally where 
    the observations are multiplied by their weights. But instead of dividing
    by the number of observations to calculate the mean, the sum of weights
    times observations is divided by the sum of the weights. Note that when
    the weights are all set to 1, the WeghtedTally reduces to the ordinary
    Tally.
      
    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the WeightedTally is often used with elapsed
    time as the weights (See the `EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally` class and
    the 'SimPersistent' class later in this module). This creates a 
    time-weighted statistic that can for instance be used to calculate 
    statistics for (average) queue length, or (average) utilization of a server.

        observation. For the unbiased version, two observations with non-zero 
        weights are needed. When too few observations were registered, NaN 
        is returned. 
        
        The formula for the biased (population) weighted variance is:
        
         .. math::
            \sigma^{2}_{W} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_i (x_i - \mu_{W})^2}}

        :math:`n` is the number of observations, and :math:`\mu_W` is the
        weighted mean of the observations.
        
        For the unbiased (sample) weighted variance, different algorithms are 
        suggested by the literature. As an example, R and MATLAB calculate 
        weighted sample variance differently.  SPSS rounds the sum of weights 
        to the nearest integer and counts that as the 'sample size' in the 
        unbiased formula. When weights are used as so-called reliability 
        weights (non-integer) rather than as frequency weights (integer), 
        rounding to the nearest integer and using that to calculate a 
        'sample size' is obviously incorrect. See the discussion at
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Weighted_sample_variance
        and at
        https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/51442/weighted-variance-one-more-time.
        Here we have chosen to implement the version that uses reliability
        weights. The reason is that the weights in simulation study are most 
        usually time intervals that can be on any (non-integer) scale.
        
        The formula used for the unbiased (sample) weighted variance is:

        where :math:`w_i` are the weights, :math:`x_i` are the observations,
        :math:`n` is the number of observations, :math:`M` is the number of

        Parameters
        ----------
        biased: bool
            Whether to return the biased (population) variance or the 
            unbiased (sample) variance. By default, biased is True and the
            population variance is returned.
        
        Returns
        -------
        float
            The weighted variance of all observations since the initialization, 
            or NaN when too few (non-zero) observations were registered.

                return w_pop_var
            elif self._n_nonzero > 1:
                return w_pop_var * self._n_nonzero / (self._n_nonzero - 1)
        return math.nan
    
    def weighted_stdev(self, biased: bool=True) -> float:
        r"""
        Return the (biased) weighted population standard deviation of all 
        observations since the statistic initialization. The biased version 
        needs at least one observation. For the unbiased version, two 
        observations are needed. When too few observations were registered, 
        NaN is returned.
        
        The formula for the biased (population) weighted standard deviation is:
        
         .. math::
            \sigma_{W} = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_i (x_i - \mu_{W})^2}}
                                     {\sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_i}} }
        
        where :math:`w_i` are the weights, :math:`x_i` are the observations,
        :math:`n` is the number of observations, and :math:`\mu_W` is the
        weighted mean of the observations.
            
        For the unbiased (sample) weighted variance (and, hence, for the 
        standard deviation), different algorithms are suggested by the 
        literature. As an example, R and MATLAB calculate weighted sample 
        variance differently.  SPSS rounds the sum of weights to the nearest 
        integer and counts that as the 'sample size' in the unbiased formula. 
        When weights are used as so-called reliability weights (non-integer) 
        rather than as frequency weights (integer), rounding to the nearest 
        integer and using that to calculate a 'sample size' is obviously 
        incorrect. See the discussion at
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Weighted_sample_variance
        and at
        https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/51442/weighted-variance-one-more-time.
        Here we have chosen to implement the version that uses reliability
        weights. The reason is that the weights in simulation study are most 
        usually time intervals that can be on any (non-integer) scale.
        
        The formula used for the unbiased (sample) weighted standard deviation is:

         .. math::
            S_{W} = \sqrt{ \frac{M}{M - 1} . \sigma^2_{W} }
            
        or as a complete formula:
        
         .. math::
            S_{W} = \sqrt{ \frac{M}{M - 1} .
                           \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_i (x_i - \mu_{W})^2}}
                                {\sum_{i=1}^{n}{w_i}} }
        
        where :math:`w_i` are the weights, :math:`x_i` are the observations,
        :math:`n` is the number of observations, :math:`M` is the number of
        non-zero observations, and :math:`\mu_W` is the weighted mean of 
        the observations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        biased: bool
            Whether to return the biased (population) standard deviation or the 
            unbiased (sample) standard deviation. By default, biased is True

class TimestampWeightedTally(WeightedTally):
    """
    The TimestampWeightedTally is a statistics object that calculates 
    descriptive statistics for piecewise constant observations, such as 
    weighted mean, weighted variance, minimum observation, maximum 
    observation, etc. Contrary to the WeightedTally, the weights are 
    implicitly calculated based on **timestamps** that are provided with 
    each observation.
    
    The initialize() method resets the statistics object. The initialize 
    method can, for instance, be called when the warmup period of the 
    simulation experiment has completed. 
    
    In order to properly 'close' the series of observations, a virtual 
    observation has to be provided at the end of the observation period, to 
    count the value and duration of the last interval into the statistics. The 
    `end_observations` method takes care of ending the observation period. 
    After calling `end_observations(timestamp)`, further calls to the 
    `register` method will be silently ignored.

    In a sense, the TimestampWeightedTally can be seen as a normal Tally 
    where the observations are multiplied by the duration (interval between two
    successive timestamps) when the observation had that particular value. 
    But instead of dividing by the number of observations to calculate the 
    mean of the ordinary Tally, the sum of durations times observation values 
    is divided by the total duration of the observation period till the last 
    registered timestamp.
      
    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the TimestampWeightedTally is often used 
    to calculate statistics for (average) queue length, or (average) 
    utilization of a server. Every time the actual queue length or utilization 
    changes, the new value is registered with the timestamp, and the 
    **previous** observation value is counted towards the statistic with the 
    time interval between the previous timestamp and the new timestamp as the
    weight.

    This event-based statistic object also fire events with the values of 
    the calculated statistics values, so a GUI-element such as a graph or

    The EventBasedTally is a statistics object that calculates descriptive 
    statistics for a number of observations, such as mean, variance, minimum, 
    maximum, skewness, etc. 
    
    The initialize() method resets the statistics object. The initialize 
    method can, for instance, be called when the warmup period of the 
    simulation experiment has completed. 
    
    The mean of the EventBasedTally is calculated with the formula:
    
    .. math:: \mu = \sum_{i=1}^{n} {x_{i}} / n
    
    where n is the number of observations and :math:`x_{i}` are the 
    observations.
    
    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the EventBasedTally can be used to calculate 
    statistical values for waiting times in queues, time in system of entities, 
    processing times at a server, and throughput times of partial processes.
    When objects such as Servers or Entities are EventProducers, they can
    easily feed the EventBasedTally when their internal state changes.

    In a sense, the weighted tally can be seen as a normal Tally where

    by the number of observations to calculate the mean, the sum of weights
    times observations is divided by the sum of the weights. Note that when

    Tally.
      
    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the (event based) WeightedTally is often 
    used with elapsed time as the weights (See the 
    `EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally` class and the 'SimPersistent' class 
    later in this module). This creates a time-weighted statistic that can 
    for instance be used to calculate statistics for (average) queue length, 
    or (average) utilization of a server.

    observation, etc. Contrary to the WeightedTally, the weights are 
    implicitly calculated based on **timestamps** that are provided with 
    each observation.
    
    The initialize() method resets the statistics object. The initialize 
    method can, for instance, be called when the warmup period of the 
    simulation experiment has completed. 
    
    In order to properly 'close' the series of observations, a virtual 
    observation has to be provided at the end of the observation period, to 
    count the value and duration of the last interval into the statistics. The 
    `end_observations` method takes care of ending the observation period. 
    After calling `end_observations(timestamp)`, further calls to the 
    `register` method will be silently ignored.

    In a sense, the EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally can be seen as a normal 
    Tally where the observations are multiplied by the duration (interval 
    between two successive timestamps) when the observation had that particular 
    value. But instead of dividing by the number of observations to calculate 
    the mean of the ordinary Tally, the sum of durations times observation 
    values is divided by the total duration of the observation period till 
    the last registered timestamp.
      
    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally is often 
    used to calculate statistics for (average) queue length, or (average) 
    utilization of a server. Every time the actual queue length or utilization 
    changes, the new value is registered with the timestamp, and the 
    **previous** observation value is counted towards the statistic with the 
    time interval between the previous timestamp and the new timestamp as the
    weight.

        Construct a new EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally statistics object. The 
        EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally can receive its observations by subscribing 
        (listening) to one or more EventProducers that provides the values 
        for the statistic using the EventProducer's `fire(...)` method. 
        This way, the statistic gathering and processing is decoupled from

class SimCounter(EventBasedCounter, SimStatisticsInterface):
    """
    The SimCounter receive the observations in the same way as the 
    EventBasedCounter statistics class, but this class is also aware of the 
    Simulator. This means they can (a) subscribe to the Simulator's 
    WARMUP_EVENT taking care that the statistics are initialized appropriately,
    and (b) register themselves as output statistics in the model. The 
    SimCounter can immediately register itself with an `EventProducer` 
    for a certain EventType in the model, that will generate the data for 
    the statistics object. The `EventProducer` and EventTypes to listen to 
    can also be added later with the `listen_to` method.
    
    Sending the events with observations is done by the EventProducer's 
    `fire(...)` method. This way, the statistic gathering and processing is 
    decoupled from the process in the simulation that generates the data: 
    there can be zero, one, or many statistics listeners for each data 
    producing object in the simulation.
    
    This event-based statistic object also fires timestamped events with 
    the values of the calculated statistics values, so a GUI-element such 
    as a graph or table can subscribe to this event-based statistics object and 
    be  automatically updated when values of the statistic change. Again, this
    provides decoupling and flexibility where on beforehand it is not known
    whether zero, one, or many (graphics or simulation) objects are interested
    in the values that this statistics object calculates.  
    
    The SimCounter is a simple statistics object that can count events 
    or occurrences. Note that the number of observations is not necessarily
    equal to the value of the counter, since the counter allows any 
    integer as the increment (or decrement) during an observation.
    
    Given the fact that the SimCounter is linked to the Simulator, it is
    subscribed to the WARMUP_EVENT of the Simulator to initialize the 
    statistics.
    
    Note
    ----
    Since the statistics need to be registered in the Model to ensure that
    they are captured and saved for the Experiment results, the instantiation
    of the SimCounter needs to be done in the `construct_model` method of the
    DSOLModel, and *not* in the constructor of the DSOLModel. 
    
    Example
    -------
    In simulation, the SimCounter can be used to count arrivals, the number of
    processed entities in servers, the number of entities in the system, etc.

class SimTally(EventBasedTally, SimStatisticsInterface):
    """
    The SimTally receive the observations in the same way as the 
    EventBasedTally statistics class, but this class is also aware of the 
    Simulator. This means they can (a) subscribe to the Simulator's 
    WARMUP_EVENT taking care that the statistics are initialized appropriately,
    and (b) register themselves as output statistics in the model. The 
    SimTally can immediately register itself with an `EventProducer` 
    for a certain EventType in the model, that will generate the data for 
    the statistics object. The `EventProducer` and EventTypes to listen to 
    can also be added later with the `listen_to` method.
    
    The SimTally can receive its observations by subscribing 
    (listening) to one or more EventProducers that provides the values for 
    the statistic using the EventProducer's `fire(...)` method. This way, the 
    statistic gathering and processing is decoupled from the process in the 
    simulation that generates the data: there can be zero, one, or many 
    statistics listeners for each data producing object in the simulation.
    
    This event-based statistic object also fire events with the values of 
    the calculated statistics values, so a GUI-element such as a graph or 
    table can subscribe to this event-based statistics object and be 
    automatically updated when values of the statistic change. Again, this
    provides decoupling and flexibility where on beforehand it is not known
    whether zero, one, or many (graphics or simulation) objects are interested
    in the values that this statistics object calculates.  
    
    The SimTally is a statistics object that calculates descriptive 
    statistics for a number of observations, such as mean, variance, minimum, 
    maximum, skewness, etc. 
    
    The initialize() method resets the statistics object. The initialize 
    method can, for instance, be called when the warmup period of the 
    simulation experiment has completed. 
    
    The mean of the SimTally is calculated with the formula:
    
    .. math:: \mu = \sum_{i=1}^{n} {x_{i}} / n
    
    where n is the number of observations and :math:`x_{i}` are the 
    observations.
    
    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the SimTally can be used to calculate 
    statistical values for waiting times in queues, time in system of entities, 
    processing times at a server, and throughput times of partial processes.
    When objects such as Servers or Entities are EventProducers, they can
    easily feed the EventBasedTally when their internal state changes.

    The initialize() method resets the statistics object. The initialize

    In a sense, the weighted tally can be seen as a normal Tally where 
    the observations are multiplied by their weights. But instead of dividing
    by the number of observations to calculate the mean, the sum of weights
    times observations is divided by the sum of the weights. Note that when
    the weights are all set to 1, the WeghtedTally reduces to the ordinary
    Tally.
      
    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the (event based) WeightedTally is often 
    used with elapsed time as the weights (See the 'SimPersistent' class 
    later in this module). This creates a time-weighted statistic that can 
    for instance be used to calculate statistics for (average) queue length, 
    or (average) utilization of a server.

class SimPersistent(EventBasedTimestampWeightedTally, SimStatisticsInterface):
    """
    The SimPersistent receive the observations in the same way as the 
    EventBasedWeigtedTally statistics class, but this class is also aware of  
    the Simulator. This means they can (a) subscribe to the Simulator's 
    WARMUP_EVENT taking care that the statistics are initialized appropriately,
    and (b) register themselves as output statistics in the model. The 
    SimPersistent can immediately register itself with an `EventProducer` 
    for a certain EventType in the model, that will generate the data for 
    the statistics object. The `EventProducer` and EventTypes to listen to 
    can also be added later with the `listen_to` method.
    
    The SimPersistent can receive its observations by 
    subscribing (listening) to one or more EventProducers that provides the 
    values for the statistic using the EventProducer's `fire(...)` method. 
    This way, the statistic gathering and processing is decoupled from the 
    process in the simulation that generates the data: there can be zero, one, 
    or many statistics listeners for each data producing object in the 
    simulation.
    
    This event-based statistic object also fire events with the values of 
    the calculated statistics values, so a GUI-element such as a graph or 
    table can subscribe to this event-based statistics object and be 
    automatically updated when values of the statistic change. Again, this
    provides decoupling and flexibility where on beforehand it is not known
    whether zero, one, or many (graphics or simulation) objects are interested
    in the values that this statistics object calculates.  

    The SimPersistent is a statistics object that calculates 
    descriptive statistics for piecewise constant observations, such as 
    weighted mean, weighted variance, minimum observation, maximum 
    observation, etc. Contrary to the WeightedTally, the weights are 
    implicitly calculated based on **timestamps** that are provided with 
    each observation.
    
    The initialize() method resets the statistics object. The initialize 
    method can, for instance, be called when the warmup period of the 
    simulation experiment has completed. 
    
    In order to properly 'close' the series of observations, a virtual 
    observation has to be provided at the end of the observation period, to 
    count the value and duration of the last interval into the statistics. The 
    `end_observations` method is automatically called at the end of the 
    replication. After the replication has ended, further calls to the 
    `register` method will be silently ignored.

    In a sense, the SimPersistent can be seen as a normal Tally where the 
    observations are multiplied by the duration (interval between two 
    successive timestamps) when the observation had that particular value. 
    But instead of dividing by the number of observations to calculate 
    the mean of the ordinary Tally, the sum of durations times observation 
    values is divided by the total duration of the observation period till 
    the last registered timestamp.

    Example
    -------
    In discrete-event simulation, the SimPersistent is often used to 
    calculate statistics for (average) queue length, or (average) utilization 
    of a server. Every time the actual queue length or utilization changes, 
    the new value is registered with the timestamp, and the **previous** 
    observation value is counted towards the statistic with the time interval 
    between the previous timestamp and the new timestamp as the weight.
