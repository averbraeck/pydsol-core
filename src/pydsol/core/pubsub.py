"""
the pubsub module contains a number of base classes for the publish/subscribe 
pattern as used in pydsol. The package is based on the Java 
implementation of DSOL (Distributed Simulation Object Library), 
first documented in 2002. Information about the Java and Python DSOL 
libraries can be found at https://simulation.tudelft.nl. Specific 
information about the publish/subscribe implementation in Java can be 
found in the djutils project (Delft Java Utilities) at https://djutils.org

Typically, implemented listener classes inherit from the abstract base class
EventListener (possibly through mixin), and classes that produce events 
inherit from the abstract base class EventProducer (possibly using multiple 
inheritance). 

The whole idea of publish/subscribe is that you decouple the producer of
information and the possible receiver(s), which otherwise has to be
hardcoded, making information exchange between objects very inflexible. 
With pub/sub, the producer will notify only subscribed objects of the 
content in the event. The receivers can change dynamically over time, by 
subscribing or unsubscribing for the receipt of certain EventTypes. We call 
the process of producing an event by the publisher "firing" of an event 
with the fire() method; receipt by the receiver is done in the notify() 
method. 

Note that Events are completely different from SimEvents. Events are used
in publish/subscribe; SimEvents contain information about code to be 
executed at a later point in time.

    """
    EventType is a strongly typed identifier for an event, which can contain
    additional information about the event itself such as metadata. The
    EventType is typically instantiated as a static variable in a class.
    
    The implementation of the `EventType` takes care that there will not be
    a problem with duplicate names for EventTypes. As part of the `EventType`,
    the defining class is coded as well to make the `EventType` unique. So,
    in the above example, the name "Producer.PRODUCTION" is stored internally
    as the unique name for the `EventType`.
    
    Example
    -------
        .. code-block:: python
        
           class Producer
               PRODUCTION_EVENT = EventType("PRODUCTION")
        
        The event type can then be used anywhere in the code as 
        `Producer.PRODUCTION_EVENT`. Note that an `Event` and a `SimEvent` 
        are two completely different concepts: Events are for the 
        publish/subscribe pattern, SimEvents are to store deferred method 
        information.

    The EventListener is an interface for a class that needs to be able to

    events, a listener has to implement the notify() method. In the
    notify() method, events can be tested for their EventType with if-elif
