pydsol-core documentation
=========================

pydsol-core is the core library for discrete simulation bsed on the Java 
DSOL (Distributed Simulation Object Library) framework. pydsol is a library
to quickly build simulation models, ranging from extremely simple queueing
models to extended discrete-event or agent-based models. The pydsol
framework is fully object oriented, so a model is built by building and 
instantiating Pyton classes.

pydsol-core provides a rich set of classes in a number of basic basic modules 
to construct and run a basic discrete simulation model:

* model.py: the **Model** that contains the logic of the simulation to run.
* simulator.py: the **Simulator** that can execute the discrete model.
* eventlist.py: the core event scheduling data structure of the Simulator.
* simevent.py: the events that are scheduled on the event list. 
* experiment.py: the **Experiment** that defines the experimental design.
* parameters.py: the input parameters for the simulation model.
* statistics.py: calculation of the output results of the simulation model.
* distributions.py: stochastic distributions to use in stochastic models.
* streams.py: random number streams that the experiment and distributions use.
* units.py: strongly types quantities such as Length and Speed for modeling.
* supporting modules include interfaces.py and utils.py with generic functions.

The basic idea of the pydsol framework is that a *Simulator* executes an 
*Experiment* for a *Model*. The Experiment defines *Random Streams* for 
stochastic *Distributions*. *Input Parameters* and *Statistics* define the 
inputs and outpus of the model. This framework links exactly to the formal
definition of simulation models, e.g. according to `Zeigler et al. (2000)
<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/580780>`__.  

pydsol-core is used as a basis in other packages such as **pydsol-model** that provides standard model objects suitable for
developing a discrete event simulation model. Standard model objects are source, server
using resources, sink, node, link, entity and vehicle. For more information,
see https://pydsol-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.
